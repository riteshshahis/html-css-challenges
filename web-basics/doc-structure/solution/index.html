        The obesity epidemic observed in the UK and other Western nations over
        the past two decades has "increased the focus on eating habits of the
        nation" (James, 2008, p. S120). In an attempt to promote better health
        of the population and reduce the burden of obesity and related health
        conditions on the NHS, the recent government white paper Healthy
        Lives, Healthy People (HM Government, 2010, p. 19) has identified
        improvements in diet and lifestyle as a priority in public health
        policy.

        It is widely accepted that students leaving home to attend university
        are likely to experience a significant shift in their lifestyle,
        including their diet, and this is supported by research evidence from
        the UK and other European countries (Papadaki et al., 2007, p. 169).
        This may encompass increased alcohol intake, reduced intake of fruit
        and vegetables, and increased intake of processed or fatty foods, "as
        well as impacting on overall eating patterns" (Arnot, 2010, online;
        Dodd et al., 2010, p. 73; Spanos & Hankey, 2010, p. 102).

        Some studies have suggested that there may be different patterns of
        unhealthy eating amongst male and female groups of students. For
        example research conducted by Dr. Ricardo Costa and Dr. Farzad
        Amirabdollahian at Coventry University found that male students may be
        at risk of what they term “disordered eating patterns”. In addition,
        the study also suggests that males are at greater risk of not eating
        five portions of fruit and vegetables per day. This research is based
        on a substantial sample size, using data derived from in-depth
        interviews with approximately 130 undergraduates, although there are
        plans to increase this to include nearly 400 participants. It is
        acknowledged by the researchers that this may represent only those
        events occurring at one university, although there are also plans to
        expand the study sample across another two universities in the future
        (Arnot, 2010, online).
