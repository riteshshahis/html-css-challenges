      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The obesity epidemic observed in the UK and other Western nations over
        the past two decades has
        <quote>"increased the focuson eating habits of the nation"</quote>
        <cite>(James, 2008, p. S120)</cite>. In an attempt to promote better
        health of the population and reduce the burden of obesity and related
        health conditions on the NHS, the recent government white paper
        Healthy Lives, Healthy People
        <cite>(HM Government, 2010, p. 19)</cite> has identified improvements
        in diet and lifestyle as a priority in public health policy.

      <h2>Eating Habits of University Students</h2>

      <p>
        It is widely accepted that <b>students leaving home</b> to attend
        university are likely to experience a significant shift in their
        lifestyle, including their diet, and this is supported by research
        evidence from the UK and other European countries
        <cite>(Papadaki et al., 2007, p. 169)</cite>. This may encompass
        increased alcohol intake, reduced intake of fruit and vegetables, and
        increased intake of processed or fatty foods,
        <quote>"as well as impacting on overall eating patterns"</quote>
        <cite>(Arnot, 2010,online; Dodd et al., 2010, p. 73; Spanos & Hankey,
          2010, p. 102).</cite>

        Some studies have suggested that there may be different patterns of
        unhealthy eating amongst male and female groups of students. For
        example research conducted by Dr. Ricardo Costa and Dr. Farzad
        Amirabdollahian at <b>Coventry University</b> found that male students
        may be at risk of what they term
        <quote>“disordered eating patterns” </quote>. In addition, the study
        also suggests that males are at greater risk of not eating five
        portions of fruit and vegetables per day. This research is based on a
        substantial sample size, using data derived from in-depth interviews
        with approximately 130 undergraduates, although there are plans to
        increase this to include nearly 400 participants. It is acknowledged
        by the researchers that this may represent only those events occurring
        at one university, although there are also plans to expand the study
        sample across another two universities in the future
